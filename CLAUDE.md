# Computational Social Science Research Best Practices

We're building rigorous, reproducible research together.
Listed below are the best practices we agree to follow.

## 1. Goals

Above all else, we are striving for high-quality, reproducible scientific code.
It should prioritize **clarity over speed**, so that others can understand it and reproduce it.
This means that we will document assumptions and rationale for data collection, wrangling, and analysis decisions with comments throughout the code.

## 2. Coding & Documentation Standards

### 2.1a  Python Script Header

```python
"""
Purpose:
    Brief description of the scripts purpose.

Notes:
    Include details about how the script works, assumptions/decisions made so that independent reviewers can understand how analyses were done.

Input:
    - List of input files, command-line flags, etc. are saved here.

Output:
    - Generated files with the full output format.
    - Should include pertinent information about the data. For example, columnar data should include a list of the columns and their definitions.

Author: Matthew DeVerna
"""
```

### 2.1b  Python Module Header

Include only a brief description of the module purpose.
For example, a module file called `utils.py` might look like this.

```python
"""
Convenience utility functions are saved here.
"""

# Imports ...
# Functions ...
```

### 2.2  Script Organization

- Imports → constants (UPPERCASE, grouped) → functions/classes → `main()`
- Use `pathlib` and `os` for paths.
- Add `os.chdir(Path(__file__).resolve().parent)` at top of **ALL SCRIPTS** and use relative paths so that scripts run when called from any location.
- Scripts should be organized for **simplicity** and **readability** for a wide scientific audience.

### 2.3  Function Docstrings (Pandas / NumPy style)

```python
def calculate_demographic_shift(df, baseline_year, target_year):
    """
    Return the percentage change in demographic groups between two years.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        Census data with demographic information and time series.
    baseline_year : int
        The starting year for the comparison.
    target_year : int
        The ending year for the comparison.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        A DataFrame showing the percent change in demographic group sizes
        between `baseline_year` and `target_year`.
    """
```

### 2.4  Directory‑Level README

Every directory _must_ contain a `README.md` file that lists the purpose of the directory and contents.
It should be updated whenever the contents change.

See @.claude/reference/reference-readme.md and use it as the canonical example for structure and tone.
